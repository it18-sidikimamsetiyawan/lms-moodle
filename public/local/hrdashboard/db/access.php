/**
 * Capabilities for local_hrdashboard.
 *
 * viewown  - the personal "My Learning" dashboard. Every authenticated user.
 * viewhr   - the HR monitoring dashboard. Defined at course-category level so it
 *            can be granted site-wide (system context = every category) or for
 *            one category only (= limited scope). Personal data of other users
 *            is exposed, hence RISK_PERSONAL.
 * export   - download the HR report (CSV/Excel/PDF).
